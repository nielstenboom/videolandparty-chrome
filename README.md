# Videoland Party Chrome Extension

This repository contains code for a Chrome extension to watch Videoland shows/movies synchronized with friends. It is a slightly altered version of the famous Netflix Party extension, so all credits to the original author!

## Development

You can test the extension locally by spinning up a local instance of the [chat server](https://github.com/nielstenboom/videolandparty-server) and by creating a chrome extension from the location where you cloned this directory, for instructions on how to point chrome to a local extension see this URL https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted 

Now you can test and debug the application by opening two tabs playing the same video on Videoland https://www.videoland.com/
